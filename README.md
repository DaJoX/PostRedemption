## About Product

This is a "trash" game, through "picking up garbage/ garbage classification/ garbage recycling" and other fun game process to guide users to understand the knowledge of garbage classification, leting people understand that garbage can also create new value, so as to promote the world environmental protection and sustainable development.

Also, there will be lot of blockchain elements in it, like NFTs, tokens...etc. It's no surprise to find anything in the trash, right?

## Whatâ€™s next

We are building the first version of the product during the GR-14 hackathon. In future releases, we plan to build a 3D scene and incorporate AR/VR technology to show more gameplay. Also, we hope to cooperate with big brands that use recycled materials to produce their products, help them better practice sustainable development.

## How to use grant

We will use the grant to build our team and develop the product.

## About Team

We now just build a small team for GR-14 hackathon. We have less than 10 people from more than 5 different regions/countries with different backgrounds. We hope to keep running our project after the hackathon and publish the game in next few months. 
We may build a discord after the hackathon. However, you can follow us on Twitter.
Together, we will build a great product and help make the earth a better greener place.
